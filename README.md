> [!TIP]
> Description

- **View PDFs:**

*Open and interact with all types of PDF content including forms and multimedia.*

- **Easily leave comments or annotate PDFs:**

*Simply annotate documents using sticky notes, type text directly on the page, highlight, underline, or use strikethrough tools, and even draw on the screen with a freehand drawing tool.*

- **Fill, e-sign, and lock your forms:**

*Fill out and e-sign PDF forms fast and share locked copies that become invalid if they are edited.*

- **Collaborate better with PDFs:**

**Share PDFs and gather comments from multiple people in one file. Recipients get an email with a link to your PDF. They just click to open, view, and comment. Reviewers can respond to each other’s comments and you get notified of activity. It’s that easy.**
